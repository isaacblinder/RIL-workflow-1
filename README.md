# RIL-workflow
# Welcome to the RIL-workflow project!
- While completing the first part of this project we learned about creating a Github repo, as well as the different options available for creation
- In the second part of the project I learned how to fork / clone a repo and add an upstream branch.
- In the third part of the project I learned about reporting issues, and added my first issue.
